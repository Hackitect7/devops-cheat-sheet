## Reporting a vulnerability

Please report security issues via **GitHub Security Advisories** (preferred) or email: **security@hackitect7.dev** (PGP optional).
Do not create public issues for vulnerabilities.

Provide:

- Affected page(s) / URL(s), reproduction steps

- Any screenshots or PoC

We will:

- Acknowledge receipt within **3 business days**

We do not run server-side code; issues typically relate to:
