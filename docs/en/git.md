## üí° Git Aliases (Useful Shortcuts)

Set up convenient aliases to speed up common Git commands:

```bash
git config --global alias.br branch                                       # shortcut for: git branch
git config --global alias.ci commit                                       # shortcut for: git commit
git config --global alias.co checkout                                     # shortcut for: git checkout
git config --global alias.graph "log --oneline --graph --all --decorate"  # pretty history graph
git config --global alias.last "log -1 HEAD"                              # show the last commit
git config --global alias.st status                                       # shortcut for: git status
