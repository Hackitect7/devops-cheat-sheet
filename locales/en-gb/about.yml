  philosophy:
    title: "My Engineering Philosophy"
    body1: |
      **Hackitect7** is my engineering alias and mindset:  
      **diagnose quickly**, **design like an architect**, and **deliver to production**
      *without unnecessary complexity*.
    body2: |
      This is not just a nickname — it is a philosophy of approaching technology:
      finding balance between speed and reliability, and always aiming for practical results.

      goal2: "explain not only *how*, but also *why* things work;"
      goal3: "ensure **multilingual access** (27 languages) for global reach;"
      goal4: "grow an **open knowledge base** welcoming community contributions."
