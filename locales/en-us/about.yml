  philosophy:
    title: "My Engineering Philosophy"
    body1: |
      **Hackitect7** is my engineering alias and mindset:  
      **diagnose fast**, **design like an architect**, and **ship to production**
      *without unnecessary complexity*.
    body2: |
      This is not just a nickname — it is a philosophy of approaching technology:
      finding balance between speed and reliability, and always aiming for practical results.

  purpose:
    title: "Purpose of the Project"
    body: |
      The **DevOps Cheat Sheet** started as a personal collection of notes and commands that I used in my daily work.
      Over time, it grew into a structured reference, and now into a full multilingual website designed to help engineers across the world.
    goals:
      title: "**Main goals of the project:**"
      goal1: provide **fast access** to commands, configs, and scenarios;  
      goal2: explain not only *how*, but also *why* things work;  
      goal3: keep **multilingual access** (27 languages) for global reach;  
      goal4: grow an **open knowledge base** welcoming community contributions.
